# Ente Photos Flathub

This repository contains tooling for the 
[Ente Photos Flathub package](https://flathub.org/apps/io.ente.photos).

All source code for Ente, including the Ente Photos desktop app, is in
[ente-io/ente](https://github.com/ente-io/ente). Please open any issues and
feature requests there.

## Experimental Wayland support

Wayland on Electon may not always work well. You can try it out anyway by granting access to the `wayland` socket, and setting the environment variable `ELECTRON_OZONE_PLATFORM_HINT=auto`. Use [Flatseal](https://flathub.org/apps/com.github.tchx84.Flatseal) for an easy to use experience.
